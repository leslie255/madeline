**A less professional version of LLVM (WIP)**

I'm planning to use this project as the backend of [leslie255/sharklang](https://github.com/leslie255/sharklang).

## What does it do?
Like LLVM, Madeline is a compiler backend, it takes in some IR - Intermedia Representation code, a type of code that is more abstract than machine code, but more basic than higher level programming languages like C, and generates a compiled program from that.
The current features of Madeline is pretty limited, it can only generates x86_64 NASM assembly in macho64 and elf64 format.
